# Title

A Practical Introduction To Machine Learning.


# Type

Tutorial - 90 minutes


# Public Abstract

Machine learning is a hot topic, with lots of hype about what it can and might do. Given the broad landscape of machine learning, and the continuing proliferation of new tools and techniques it can be difficult to get a pragmatic view of how machine learning can be used, or even where to start.

This tutorial will provide a high level introduction to machine learning: what it is, what kind of problems we can solve with it, and how can we apply it. In doing so this tutorial will also introduce the scikit-learn library and show you why this library is a central part of the machine learning ecosystem in Python.

We will start from scratch with a small example dataset, and walk through the process of building and carefully validating a classifier with scikit-learn. The practical focus during the tutorial will be on hands on implementation and experimentation. The technical focus will be on machine learning algorithms as black boxes for making decisions.

Assumed background: This tutorial only assumes that you are comfortable with Python the language. We will *not* assume that you have any maths background, or that you are familiar with numerical computing: discussion of maths and algorithms will be strictly limited to vague hand waving.


# Private Abstract

    This will only be shown to organisers and reviewers. You should provide any details about your proposal that you don't want to be public here.

    Please fill out an approximate timeline for the content of your presentation to help the programme committee understand the details of your proposal. You are welcome to use a non-standard talk structure instead, however many authors will find this basic template helpful:


## Timeline

00 - 05 minutes: Setup.
05 - 20 minutes: Introduction to machine learning.
                 Introducing the workshop dataset.
20 - 30 minutes: Choosing features to represent your dataset.
30 - 40 minutes: The scikit-learn estimator interface for training classifiers.
                 Choosing classifier parameters.
40 - 60 minutes: Validating the performance of your model.
60 - 80 minutes: End to end machine learning with pipelines.
80 - 90 minutes: Wrap up and question time.


## Tutorial Background

This tutorial is a combined effort between the three of us. It combines the dataset and general structure from Jack Simpson's tutorial at ResBaz in February 2016 [1], with the more in depth coverage of the scikit-learn api from a workshop Sam Hames gave at the Brisbane Python meetup [2]. The source material for the teaching content is open licensed and publicly available [3]. The long term plan is to develop this material into a Data Carpentry module.

## Differences from other tutorials

No doubt other tutorials are being proposed for this conference. Why do we think this tutorial is of particular benefit to the broader Python community? The difference for this tutorial is that we are explicitly targeting this tutorial as an introduction to the field, rather than at an advanced or even intermediate level as many other tutorials tend to focus on.

For example at the 2015 PyCon-AU Tennessee Leeuwenburg's "Applied Data Science" tutorial covered: random forests, neural networks, deep learning. Along the way it covered high level interfaces, low level algorithmic details and specific api details. It provides an effective high level technical overview of a broad field, for someone who already has some experience, but isn't focused enough to be fully accessible for someone with no experience in this field.

Learning from the experience and positioning of these previous talks, and our extensive experience running Software Carpentry workshops for novice programmers, we have structured this tutorial to focus on interactive coverage of a small number of core machine learning topics, rather than a lightning style demo of a many different libraries and techniques.


## Why three speakers?

One of our key experiences as Software Carpentry instructors is that running a tutorial is a lot of work for a single person: having three people in the room working on the tutorial makes everything run smoothly. We don't have to choose between presenting material to everyone and helping out the person who just can't quite get the package installed correctly.
